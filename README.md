**Intro**
  
My 3rd project is an app named Spots. The app is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. There are also various hover elements, buttons, and use of media queries.
The only changes I would suggest when assigning this project would be, to allow a little more time for completion. There are a lot of challenging aspects!
